    <p>
    Community Night of Worship was birthed out of a desire to see our community united under the name of Jesus.  We want to celebrate all that He's done, all that He's doing, and all that He will do. </p>
<p>What better way to do that than singing!</p>

        <h2>My Jesus</h2>
        <h5>Verse 1</h5>
        <p> Are you past the point of weary?</p>
        <p> Is your burden weighin' heavy?</p>
        <p> Is it all too much to carry?</p>
        <p> Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <br>

        <p> Do you feel that empty feeling?</p>
        <p> 'Cause shame's done all its stealin'</p>
        <p> And you're desperate for some healin'</p>
        <p> Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>He makes a way where there ain't no way</p>
        <p> Rises up from an empty grave</p>
        <p> Ain't no sinner that He can't save</p>
        <p> Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <br>
        <p>His love is strong and His grace is free</p>
        <p>And the good news is I know that He</p>
        <p>Can do for you what He's done for me</p>
        <p>Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <p> And let my Jesus change your life</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hallelujah</p>
        <p>Hallelujah</p>

        <p>Amen</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Verse 2</h5>
        <p> Who can wipe away the tears</p>
        <p>From broken dreams and wasted years</p>
        <p> And tell the past to disappear? </p>
        <p> Oh Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <br>

        <p> And all the wrong turns that you would</p>
        <p>Go and undo if you could</p>
        <p> Who can work it all for your good</p>
        <p> Let me tell you about my Jesus</p>

        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>He makes a way where there ain't no way</p>

        <p> Ain't no sinner that He can't save</p>
        <p> Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <br>
        <p>His love is strong and His grace is free</p>
        <p>And the good news is I know that He</p>
        <p>Can do for you what He's done for me</p>
        <p>Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <p> And let my Jesus change your life</p>
        <br>
        <p>Hallelujah</p>
        <p>Hallelujah</p>

        <p>Amen</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Verse 3</h5>
        <p> Who would take my cross to Calvary?</p>
        <p>Pay the price for all my guilty?</p>
        <p> Who would care that much about me? </p>
        <p> Oh Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <br>

        <h5>Chorus</h5>
        <p>He makes a way where there ain't no way</p>
        <p> Rises up from an empty grave</p>
        <p> Ain't no sinner that He can't save</p>
        <p> Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
        <br>
        <p>His love is strong and His grace is free</p>
        <p>And the good news is I know that He</p>
        <p>Can do for you what He's done for me</p>
        <p>Let me tell you 'bout my Jesus</p>
